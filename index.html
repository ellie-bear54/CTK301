A thing or two about something I'm interested in...
I play a sport called quidditch, and we are in the process of working out a name change. In light of J.K. Rowling's latest batch of transphobic comments, the quidditch leagues in the US have decided that now is a great time to further our efforts to distance ourselves from her.
A name change for the sport would allow us to pay our athletes and pursue sponsorship deals, since we would not need to worry about copyright laws and Cease and Desist letters from Warner Bros.
Quidditch is the only completely gender-inclusive sport while also being full-contact. The only protective equipment that is a required standard is a mouthguard. However, there are rules in place to keep players safe.
One of those rules is that you cannot rush a tackle from behind. If one player is going to tackle another player from behind, the player being tackled essentially has to back in to the player initiating the tackle.
Another rule is that face beats (taking a bludger (deflated dodgeball) to the face) from a beater within six feet of their chaser or keeper target are illegal. Face beats from outside of six feet and/or from one beater to another beater are considered legal.
Quidditch's gender-inclusivity clause goes so far as to say that there can be no more than four people of one gender from one team on the pitch at any time, including the time period known as Snitch on Pitch (SOP). When the maximum number of players on each team becomes seven (during SOP), this forces teams to allow their non-male players to get playing time.
